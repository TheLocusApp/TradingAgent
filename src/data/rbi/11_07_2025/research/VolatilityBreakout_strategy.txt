STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a specialized 0DTE (Zero Days to Expiration) day trading strategy focused on QQQ using ATR (Average True Range) for volatility-based breakout trading. The strategy capitalizes on intraday volatility expansion in QQQ options with same-day expiration.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
- Primary Instrument: QQQ options (0DTE only)
- Timeframe: 1-minute and 5-minute charts
- Trading Hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST
- Core Indicator: ATR (14-period) for volatility measurement
- Secondary Confirmation: Volume profile and price action

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. ATR (14-period) - Primary volatility gauge
2. EMA (9-period) - Short-term trend direction
3. VWAP - Volume-weighted average price for intraday levels
4. Volume - Confirmation of breakout strength

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY (Call Options):
1. Price breaks above previous 30-minute high with expanding volume
2. Current ATR value exceeds 1.5x the opening 30-minute ATR
3. Price maintains above VWAP and 9-period EMA
4. Entry on pullback to breakout level with volume confirmation

SHORT ENTRY (Put Options):
1. Price breaks below previous 30-minute low with expanding volume
2. Current ATR value exceeds 1.5x the opening 30-minute ATR
3. Price maintains below VWAP and 9-period EMA
4. Entry on retrace to breakdown level with volume confirmation

EXIT RULES:
PROFIT TARGETS:
- Primary: 1x ATR value from entry point
- Secondary: 2x ATR value for extended moves
- Time-based exit: 2:00 PM EST regardless of P/L

STOP LOSS:
- Fixed: 0.5x ATR value from entry point
- Maximum risk: 2% of trading capital per trade
- Time stop: Exit by 3:30 PM EST to avoid gamma risk

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position Sizing: Maximum 2% of account per trade
2. Daily Loss Limit: 5% of account capital
3. Maximum Trades: 3 trades per day maximum
4. No trading during first 30 minutes (9:30-10:00 AM EST)
5. Avoid trading during Fed announcements or major economic events

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Monitor QQQ's relationship with TQQQ/SQQQ for momentum confirmation
- Watch for unusual options flow in QQQ for additional confirmation
- Be aware of gamma exposure changes throughout the trading day
- Focus on high-volume breakout periods (10:00-11:30 AM and 1:00-2:30 PM EST)

This strategy requires strict discipline in position sizing and exit timing due to the high-risk nature of 0DTE options trading. The ATR-based approach helps filter false breakouts while capturing meaningful intraday volatility expansions.
