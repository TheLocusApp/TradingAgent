REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 2-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) - primary signal
- Volume confirmation (optional but recommended)
- No additional indicators to maintain strategy purity

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- This strategy requires constant monitoring due to 2m timeframe
- 0DTE options are extremely time-sensitive - avoid holding through midday lulls
- Focus on high-volatility periods (10AM-2PM EST typically best)
- Be prepared for rapid position changes - this is a scalping strategy
- Consider using bracket orders for automated entry/exit execution

The strategy capitalizes on the high sensitivity of the 2m EMA to capture quick momentum shifts in QQQ, leveraging the amplified moves of 0DTE options while minimizing overnight risk through same-day expiration.
