STRATEGY_NAME: VolumeBounce

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines support/resistance level analysis with volume confirmation to identify high-probability bounce trades on SPY 5-minute charts.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Support/Resistance Identification: Identify clear horizontal support and resistance levels using recent price action highs and lows
2. Volume Confirmation: Use volume analysis to validate the strength of bounces at key levels
3. Price Action Patterns: Look for specific candlestick patterns indicating rejection at support/resistance
4. SPY-Specific Context: Consider market hours, news events, and overall market sentiment affecting SPY

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Volume indicator (standard volume bars)
- Horizontal support/resistance lines
- Optional: 20-period EMA for additional context

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY (Support Bounce):
1. Price approaches a clearly defined support level
2. Volume increases significantly as price tests support
3. Bullish reversal candlestick pattern forms (hammer, bullish engulfing, doji with confirmation)
4. Entry on break above the high of the reversal candle
5. Stop loss placed below the support level

SHORT ENTRY (Resistance Rejection):
1. Price approaches a clearly defined resistance level
2. Volume increases as price tests resistance
3. Bearish reversal candlestick pattern forms (shooting star, bearish engulfing, evening star)
4. Entry on break below the low of the reversal candle
5. Stop loss placed above the resistance level

EXIT RULES:
- Take profit at next significant support/resistance level
- Alternative: Use 2:1 risk-reward ratio minimum
- Exit if volume decreases significantly during the move
- Exit if price fails to maintain momentum beyond entry candle

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size: Maximum 2% of account per trade
- Stop loss: 0.10-0.20 points below support (long) or above resistance (short)
- Only trade during high-volume periods (first 2 hours and last hour of trading day)
- Avoid trading during major news events or low-volume periods
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions

ADDITIONAL FILTERS:
- Wait for at least 2 touches of the support/resistance level for validation
- Prefer trades where volume is 1.5x above average during the bounce/rejection
- Avoid trading in choppy, range-bound markets without clear levels
- Consider overall market trend for higher probability setups
