STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated trend-following strategy that combines multiple technical indicators to identify high-probability bullish entries during periods of market volatility expansion.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Bullish Divergence Detection: Identifies when price makes lower lows while momentum indicator (typically RSI or MACD) makes higher lows
2. Keltner Channel Breakout: Uses the upper Keltner Channel as a dynamic resistance level
3. Bollinger Bands Volatility Expansion: Confirms increased market volatility through expanded Bollinger Bands
4. Multi-confirmation entry system requiring all three conditions to align

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Keltner Channel (20-period EMA with 2x ATR bands)
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
- Momentum oscillator (RSI 14-period recommended for divergence detection)

ENTRY RULES:
1. Identify bullish divergence between price and momentum oscillator (price makes lower low, oscillator makes higher low)
2. Confirm Bollinger Bands are expanding (width increasing, indicating volatility expansion)
3. Wait for price to break above the upper Keltner Channel
4. Enter long position when ALL THREE conditions are met simultaneously

EXIT RULES:
- Exit long position when price closes below the Keltner Channel (middle line/20-period EMA)
- Alternative exit: Set trailing stop based on recent swing low or use ATR-based stop loss

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing based on volatility (use ATR for stop loss calculation)
- Initial stop loss placed below recent swing low or using 2x ATR below entry
- Risk per trade should not exceed 1-2% of account capital
- Monitor Bollinger Band contraction as potential warning signal for trend weakness

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Strategy performs best in trending markets with periodic volatility expansions
- Avoid trading during sideways/consolidation periods with contracting Bollinger Bands
- Higher timeframe confirmation (daily/weekly) can improve signal reliability
- Consider volume confirmation for stronger breakout validation
