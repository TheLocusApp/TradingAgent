AGBot Strategy Optimization Request - TSLA 4H Timeframe

PROBLEM WITH CURRENT STRATEGY:
The AGBot strategy on TSLA 1H generates +43% return but with only +0.64% average trade size. This is too small - commissions and slippage eat the profits. We need to optimize for:
1. Larger average trade size (target: 1-2% per trade)
2. Better risk-reward ratios
3. Fewer but higher-quality trades

CURRENT BEST PARAMETERS (1H):
- MA Length: 250
- Key Value: 1.5
- Adaptive ATR Mult: 2.0
- TP1 RR Long: 0.5 (TOO SMALL - this is the problem)
- TP1 Percent: 45

OPTIMIZATION GOALS:
1. Test on TSLA 4H timeframe (fewer trades, larger moves)
2. Increase TP1 RR from 0.5 to 1.0-2.0 (let winners run more)
3. Reduce TP1 Percent from 45 to 20-30 (take smaller partial profits)
4. Adjust MA length and Key Value for 4H timeframe
5. Target: Average trade size of 1-2% minimum

PARAMETERS TO OPTIMIZE:
- ma_length: [50, 100, 150, 200] (shorter for 4H)
- key_value: [1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
- adaptive_atr_mult: [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5]
- tp1_rr_long: [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5] (INCREASED from 0.5)
- tp1_percent: [20, 25, 30] (REDUCED from 45)
- tp2_rr_long: [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

OPTIMIZATION CRITERIA:
1. Primary: Maximize average trade size (target >= 1.0%)
2. Secondary: Maintain Sharpe ratio >= 1.5
3. Tertiary: Win rate >= 60%
4. Constraint: Max drawdown <= 15%

BACKTEST SETTINGS:
- Asset: TSLA
- Timeframe: 4H (4-hour candles)
- Period: 1 year minimum
- Initial Capital: $10,000
- Commission: 0.03%
- Strategy File: src/strategies/AGBot.py

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Fewer trades (better quality)
- Larger average trade size (1-2% instead of 0.64%)
- Better risk-reward ratios
- Reduced commission impact
- More sustainable strategy

NOTES:
- Current 1H strategy has too many marginal trades
- 4H timeframe should reduce noise and improve signal quality
- Longer TP1 RR will let winners run instead of taking quick profits
- This is a fundamental strategy improvement, not just parameter tweaking
