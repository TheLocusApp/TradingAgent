STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility (squeeze) followed by high volatility expansion (breakout) using Bollinger Bands. The core principle is that periods of market consolidation and compressed volatility are often followed by significant directional moves. The strategy identifies these compression phases and enters when volatility expands with a clear directional bias.

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Bollinger Bands (20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations)
2. Volume indicator (optional but recommended for confirmation)
3. Additional momentum oscillator (RSI or Stochastic) for filter

ENTRY RULES:
1. SQUEEZE IDENTIFICATION:
   - Bollinger Bands must be compressed (band width narrow)
   - Band width should be at or near recent lows
   - Price should be trading within the bands without significant directional movement

2. BREAKOUT CONFIRMATION:
   LONG ENTRY:
   - Price closes above the upper Bollinger Band
   - Volume should be above average (confirmation)
   - RSI above 50 (momentum filter)
   - Enter on next candle open after breakout confirmation

   SHORT ENTRY:
   - Price closes below the lower Bollinger Band
   - Volume should be above average (confirmation)
   - RSI below 50 (momentum filter)
   - Enter on next candle open after breakout confirmation

EXIT RULES:
1. PROFIT TAKING:
   - Take profit when price reaches the opposite Bollinger Band
   - Or use trailing stop based on Bollinger Band middle line (20-period SMA)
   - Alternative: Take partial profits at 1:1 risk-reward ratio

2. STOP LOSS:
   - LONG POSITIONS: Place stop loss below the lower Bollinger Band
   - SHORT POSITIONS: Place stop loss above the upper Bollinger Band
   - Alternative: Use recent swing low/high for more conservative stops

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
2. Stop loss placement based on Bollinger Band width and volatility
3. Avoid trading during major economic news events when false breakouts are common
4. Wait for candle close confirmation to avoid false signals
5. Consider market context - breakouts in direction of larger trend have higher success probability

ADDITIONAL FILTERS:
- Only trade during high-volume sessions
- Avoid trading when bands are extremely wide (high volatility environment)
- Look for consecutive squeeze patterns for higher probability setups
- Consider using multiple timeframes for confirmation (e.g., daily squeeze with hourly breakout)
