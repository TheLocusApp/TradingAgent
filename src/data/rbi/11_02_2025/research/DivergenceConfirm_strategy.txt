STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceConfirm

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines RSI divergence patterns with MACD confirmation signals specifically for SPY daily charts, creating a robust mean-reversion approach with momentum validation.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Primary Instrument: SPY (S&P 500 ETF) on daily timeframe only
2. Core Pattern: RSI divergence detection between price action and RSI indicator
3. Confirmation Mechanism: MACD crossover signals to validate divergence setups
4. Timeframe Requirement: Strictly daily charts for reliable signal generation

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index): Period 14, standard settings
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): 12,26,9 standard settings

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY (Bullish Divergence):
1. Price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low (classic bullish divergence)
2. MACD histogram shows bullish crossover (turns positive) OR MACD line crosses above signal line
3. Enter on next candle open after both conditions are met

SHORT ENTRY (Bearish Divergence):
1. Price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high (classic bearish divergence)
2. MACD histogram shows bearish crossover (turns negative) OR MACD line crosses below signal line
3. Enter on next candle open after both conditions are met

EXIT RULES:
- Take Profit: 2:1 risk-reward ratio minimum
- Stop Loss: Recent swing low (for longs) or swing high (for shorts)
- Alternative Exit: When RSI reaches overbought (70+) for long positions or oversold (30-) for short positions

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position sizing: Maximum 2% risk per trade
2. Stop loss placement based on recent price structure
3. No new entries if SPY is in strong trending phase (avoid counter-trend trades during strong momentum)
4. Wait for clear divergence patterns - avoid marginal or unclear setups

ADDITIONAL FILTERS:
- Volume confirmation: Higher volume on confirmation candle increases validity
- Market context: Avoid trading during major economic events or FOMC announcements
- Pattern quality: Divergence should be clear and significant, not minor fluctuations

This strategy leverages the reliability of RSI divergence patterns while using MACD as a timing mechanism, specifically optimized for SPY's daily price action characteristics.
