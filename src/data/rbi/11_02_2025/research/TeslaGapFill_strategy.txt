STRATEGY_NAME: TeslaGapFill

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

**Strategy Overview:**
TeslaGapFill is a specialized gap trading strategy focused exclusively on Tesla (TSLA) daily price movements. The strategy capitalizes on the tendency of price gaps to "fill" or return to their pre-gap levels, leveraging Tesla's high volatility and frequent gap behavior.

**Key Strategy Components:**
1. **Gap Identification**: Monitor Tesla's daily chart for significant price gaps
2. **Gap Measurement**: Calculate gap size as percentage difference between previous close and current open
3. **Gap Classification**: Identify gap types (breakaway, common, exhaustion, runaway)
4. **Fill Probability Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood of gap closure based on market conditions

**Required Indicators:**
- Daily candlestick chart for Tesla (TSLA)
- Volume indicator
- Simple Moving Average (SMA 20) for trend context
- Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) for momentum confirmation

**Entry Rules:**
1. **Gap Detection**: Identify when Tesla opens with at least 1.5% gap from previous day's close
2. **Gap Direction**: 
   - **Gap Down Entry**: Buy when price gaps down and shows signs of reversal
   - **Gap Up Entry**: Short when price gaps up and shows reversal signals
3. **Confirmation Signals**:
   - Volume spike on gap day
   - RSI showing oversold (for gap downs) or overbought (for gap ups) conditions
   - Price action showing rejection of gap direction

**Exit Rules:**
1. **Primary Target**: Previous day's closing price (gap fill level)
2. **Alternative Targets**:
   - 50% gap fill for partial profits
   - Full gap fill for complete position exit
3. **Time-based Exit**: Close position if gap doesn't fill within 3-5 trading days
4. **Trend Failure Exit**: Exit if price moves against position by more than the initial gap size

**Risk Management:**
1. **Position Sizing**: Maximum 2% of capital per trade
2. **Stop Loss Placement**:
   - For long positions: below the gap day's low
   - For short positions: above the gap day's high
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Minimum 1:2 ratio required
4. **Maximum Daily Exposure**: No more than 6% total capital in gap trades

**Special Considerations for Tesla:**
- Account for earnings gaps (higher fill probability)
- Consider Elon Musk/Twitter impact on gap behavior
- Monitor overall market sentiment affecting tech stocks
- Be aware of Tesla's high beta and correlation with NASDAQ

**Strategy Limitations:**
- Not all gaps fill immediately
- Breakaway gaps may indicate trend changes rather than reversals
- Requires active monitoring during trading hours
- Higher volatility increases both risk and reward potential
