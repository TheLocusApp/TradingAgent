STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveDollarCost

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a systematic dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy specifically designed for QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust) that incorporates adaptive timing and position sizing based on market conditions.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Core DCA Foundation: Regular fixed-amount investments in QQQ regardless of price
2. Adaptive Timing: Uses RSI and moving averages to identify optimal entry points
3. Dynamic Position Sizing: Adjusts investment amounts based on market volatility
4. Risk Management: Built-in stop-loss and profit-taking mechanisms

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Average True Range (ATR) for volatility measurement

ENTRY RULES:
1. BASE DCA ENTRY:
   - Invest fixed amount (e.g., $500) on predetermined schedule (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly)
   - Execute regardless of market conditions (core DCA principle)

2. ENHANCED ENTRY (Adaptive Component):
   - When RSI < 40 AND price > 50-day SMA: Increase position by 25%
   - When RSI < 30 AND price > 200-day SMA: Increase position by 50%
   - When both 50-day and 200-day SMA are trending upward: Consider additional allocation

EXIT/PROFIT-TAKING RULES:
1. Partial Profit Taking:
   - Take 25% profits when position reaches 20% gain
   - Take another 25% when RSI > 70 and price is 15% above 200-day SMA

2. Full Exit Conditions:
   - Exit entire position if QQQ closes below 200-day SMA for 3 consecutive days
   - Exit if 50-day SMA crosses below 200-day SMA (death cross)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position Sizing:
   - Base allocation: 70% of planned investment
   - Enhanced allocation: 30% for opportunistic entries
   - Maximum single position increase: 50% above base amount

2. Stop-Loss Protection:
   - 8% trailing stop on enhanced positions
   - No stop on core DCA positions (maintains DCA philosophy)
   - Reduce enhanced allocation during high volatility (ATR > 3%)

3. Market Condition Adjustments:
   - Reduce enhanced entries when 50-day SMA is below 200-day SMA
   - Suspend enhanced allocations during market downturns (QQQ down >15% from highs)

MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENT:
- Weekly review of SMA alignment and RSI levels
- Monthly assessment of volatility conditions using ATR
- Quarterly rebalancing of profit-taking thresholds based on market performance

This strategy maintains the disciplined approach of traditional DCA while incorporating adaptive elements to potentially enhance returns during favorable market conditions and protect capital during downturns.
