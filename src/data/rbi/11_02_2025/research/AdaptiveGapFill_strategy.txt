STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveGapFill

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on identifying and trading gap fill opportunities in TSLA daily charts, using adaptive entry timing and momentum confirmation to improve success rates.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
- Gap identification: TSLA must gap up/down by at least 1.5% from previous close
- Gap fill definition: Price must retrace to within 0.5% of previous day's closing price
- Volume confirmation: Gap fill moves require above-average volume for validation
- Momentum filtering: Uses RSI and MACD to confirm gap fill momentum

ENTRY RULES:
1. GAP UP SCENARIO (Short entry):
   - TSLA gaps up 1.5%+ from previous close
   - Wait for price to retrace toward gap fill level
   - Enter short when RSI(14) > 60 and MACD histogram turns negative
   - Confirm with volume at least 20% above 20-day average

2. GAP DOWN SCENARIO (Long entry):
   - TSLA gaps down 1.5%+ from previous close
   - Wait for price to retrace upward toward gap fill level
   - Enter long when RSI(14) < 40 and MACD histogram turns positive
   - Confirm with volume at least 20% above 20-day average

EXIT RULES:
- Target exit: When price reaches within 0.5% of gap fill level
- Stop loss: 2% beyond entry price for both long and short positions
- Time-based exit: Close position if gap not filled within 3 trading days

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Maximum 2% of portfolio per trade
- Daily maximum: No more than 2 gap fill trades per day
- Correlation check: Avoid trading if major market events affecting TSLA
- Gap size filter: Only trade gaps between 1.5% and 8% (avoid extreme gaps)

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- RSI (14-period) for momentum confirmation
- MACD (12,26,9) for trend direction
- Volume (20-day average) for confirmation
- Daily price chart with gap identification

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TSLA:
- Account for TSLA's high volatility with wider stops (2% vs typical 1.5%)
- Monitor Tesla-specific news and events that may override technical signals
- Consider earnings gaps separately (often don't fill immediately)
- Be aware of gap-and-go patterns common in high-momentum stocks like TSLA
