RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade
- Stop loss: Place 2-3% below entry for long positions, 2-3% above entry for short positions
- Alternative stop: Use recent swing low/high as dynamic stop levels
- Time-based exit: Consider exiting if position doesn't move in expected direction within 24-48 hours
