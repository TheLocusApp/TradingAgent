STRATEGY_NAME: DualWave Crossover

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy employs a dual exponential moving average (EMA) crossover system specifically designed for SPY on the hourly timeframe, focusing on capturing medium-term trend changes with reduced lag compared to traditional moving averages.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
- Primary Instrument: SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)
- Timeframe: 1-hour charts exclusively
- Core Indicators: 13-period EMA (fast) and 48-period EMA (slow)
- Trend Detection: Uses the relationship between fast and slow EMAs to identify trend direction changes

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
- Trigger when 13-period EMA crosses ABOVE 48-period EMA
- Confirm with price action closing above both EMAs
- Enter on next candle open after crossover confirmation

SHORT ENTRY:
- Trigger when 13-period EMA crosses BELOW 48-period EMA
- Confirm with price action closing below both EMAs
- Enter on next candle open after crossover confirmation

EXIT RULES:
LONG EXIT:
- When 13-period EMA crosses below 48-period EMA
- Close position on next candle open after bearish crossover

SHORT EXIT:
- When 13-period EMA crosses above 48-period EMA
- Close position on next candle open after bullish crossover

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Stop-loss: Place 2-3 ATR (Average True Range) below entry for long positions, above entry for short positions
- Time-based exit: Consider exiting if no significant movement occurs within 5-10 bars after entry
- Avoid trading during first/last hour of market session due to increased volatility

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 48-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Optional: 14-period ATR for stop-loss calculation

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Monitor for false signals during choppy/consolidation periods
- Consider higher timeframe (daily) trend alignment for improved signal quality
- Be aware of economic events and earnings reports that may cause abnormal price action
- The 13/48 EMA combination provides balanced responsiveness while filtering minor noise on hourly charts
