STRATEGY_NAME: DualHorizon

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy employs a dual exponential moving average crossover system on SPY hourly charts, focusing on the interaction between short-term and long-term trend dynamics.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
- Primary Instruments: SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)
- Timeframe: Hourly charts exclusively
- Core Indicators: 48-period EMA and 200-period EMA
- Signal Generation: Crossover events between the two EMAs

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
- Trigger when 48 EMA crosses ABOVE 200 EMA
- Confirm bullish momentum with price trading above both EMAs
- Enter on the next hourly candle after crossover confirmation

SHORT ENTRY:
- Trigger when 48 EMA crosses BELOW 200 EMA
- Confirm bearish momentum with price trading below both EMAs
- Enter on the next hourly candle after crossover confirmation

EXIT RULES:
LONG EXIT:
- When 48 EMA crosses below 200 EMA (reverse signal)
- Or implement trailing stop of 2-3% below recent swing low

SHORT EXIT:
- When 48 EMA crosses above 200 EMA (reverse signal)
- Or implement trailing stop of 2-3% above recent swing high

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Stop loss: Place 2-3% below entry for longs, 2-3% above entry for shorts
- Maximum concurrent positions: 1-2 to avoid overexposure
- Time-based exit: Consider exiting if no significant movement occurs within 5-10 periods

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. 48-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
2. 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
3. Price action confirmation (candlestick patterns)
4. Optional: Volume confirmation for crossover validity

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- The 48/200 EMA combination provides medium-term trend identification
- Hourly timeframe balances noise reduction with timely signals
- Watch for false breakouts during low volatility periods
- Consider market context (overall S&P 500 trend) for higher probability trades
- Backtest specific to SPY's characteristic movements for optimal parameters
