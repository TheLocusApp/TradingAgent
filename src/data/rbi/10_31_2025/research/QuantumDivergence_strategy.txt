STRATEGY_NAME: QuantumDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
This is a high-frequency day trading strategy specifically designed for QQQ on 5-minute timeframes that combines RSI divergence patterns with MACD confirmation signals. The strategy focuses on identifying potential trend reversals through momentum divergence while using MACD for timing and confirmation.

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Period 14, levels 30/70
2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Standard settings (12,26,9)
3. Volume indicator (optional but recommended)

ENTRY RULES:

BULLISH SETUP:
1. RSI shows BULLISH DIVERGENCE: Price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows
2. Wait for RSI to cross above 30 level from oversold territory
3. MACD must show bullish confirmation: MACD line crosses above signal line OR histogram turns positive
4. Enter long position on the next candle after all conditions are met

BEARISH SETUP:
1. RSI shows BEARISH DIVERGENCE: Price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs
2. Wait for RSI to cross below 70 level from overbought territory
3. MACD must show bearish confirmation: MACD line crosses below signal line OR histogram turns negative
4. Enter short position on the next candle after all conditions are met

EXIT RULES:
- Take profit when RSI reaches opposite extreme (70 for long trades, 30 for short trades)
- Alternative exit: MACD shows opposite signal (cross against position direction)
- Time-based exit: Close all positions 15 minutes before market close
- Stop loss triggered if price moves against position by more than 0.5%

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1% of account per trade
2. Stop loss: 0.5% below entry for long positions, 0.5% above entry for short positions
3. Maximum 3 concurrent positions
4. No trading during first 30 minutes of market open
5. Avoid trading during major economic announcements

ADDITIONAL FILTERS:
- Volume should be above 20-period average for higher probability setups
- Look for divergence patterns that span at least 4-6 candles for stronger signals
- Prefer setups that occur during the main trading session (10:00 AM - 3:30 PM EST)

STRATEGY NOTES:
- This strategy works best in ranging or mildly trending markets
- Avoid using during strong trending days where divergence signals may fail
- Practice identifying clean divergence patterns before trading with real money
- Backtest extensively on QQQ 5-minute charts to understand strategy performance characteristics
