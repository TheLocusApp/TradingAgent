STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceCatalyst

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines RSI divergence patterns with MACD confirmation signals on Bitcoin's daily timeframe to identify high-probability reversal opportunities.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Set to 14 periods
2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Standard settings (12,26,9)
3. Price action analysis for divergence detection
4. Daily timeframe for reliable signals

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
- RSI shows BULLISH DIVERGENCE (price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low)
- MACD histogram shows upward momentum (rising bars above zero line)
- MACD line crosses above signal line OR shows bullish crossover confirmation
- Enter on next candle open after all conditions are met

SHORT ENTRY:
- RSI shows BEARISH DIVERGENCE (price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high)
- MACD histogram shows downward momentum (falling bars below zero line)
- MACD line crosses below signal line OR shows bearish crossover confirmation
- Enter on next candle open after all conditions are met

EXIT RULES:
- Take Profit: 2:1 risk-reward ratio minimum
- Stop Loss: Place below recent swing low (long) or above recent swing high (short)
- Alternative Exit: When MACD shows opposite signal (crossover against position)
- Time-based Exit: Consider exiting after 7-10 days if target not reached

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Maximum risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
- Position sizing based on stop loss distance
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades
- Wait for clear, well-defined divergence patterns only
- Avoid trading during major news events or extreme volatility

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- RSI (14 periods) - for divergence detection
- MACD (12,26,9) - for momentum confirmation
- Price chart with visible swing highs/lows

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Divergence must be clear and significant (not minor wiggles)
- Multiple timeframe confirmation (check 4H for additional context) recommended
- Volume confirmation adds extra reliability to signals
- Strategy works best in ranging or transitioning markets, less effective in strong trends
- Backtest thoroughly on historical BTC data before live implementation
