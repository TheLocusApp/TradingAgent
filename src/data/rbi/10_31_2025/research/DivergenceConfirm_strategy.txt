STRATEGY_NAME: DivergenceConfirm

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines RSI divergence patterns with MACD confirmation signals to identify high-probability reversal opportunities in trending markets.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Primary divergence detector
2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Confirmation filter
3. Price action analysis for validation

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- RSI (14-period standard setting)
- MACD (12,26,9 standard setting)
- Price chart with clear swing highs/lows

ENTRY RULES:

BULLISH DIVERGENCE SETUP:
1. Price forms LOWER LOW while RSI forms HIGHER LOW
2. MACD histogram shows bullish momentum (rising bars above zero line)
3. MACD line crosses above signal line OR shows positive divergence
4. Enter LONG when price breaks above the most recent swing high

BEARISH DIVERGENCE SETUP:
1. Price forms HIGHER HIGH while RSI forms LOWER HIGH
2. MACD histogram shows bearish momentum (falling bars below zero line)
3. MACD line crosses below signal line OR shows negative divergence
4. Enter SHORT when price breaks below the most recent swing low

CONFIRMATION CRITERIA:
- RSI divergence must be clear and significant (minimum 4-6 bars between peaks/troughs)
- MACD must confirm the momentum shift within 1-3 bars of the divergence signal
- Volume should support the reversal (increasing on breakout)

EXIT RULES:
- Take profit at previous significant support/resistance level
- OR when opposite divergence signal appears
- Stop loss placed below/above the divergence swing point
- Trail stop using MACD zero line cross as exit signal

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size: 1-2% risk per trade
- Stop loss: 1.5-2x ATR from entry point
- Risk-reward ratio: Minimum 1:2
- Maximum 3 concurrent divergence trades

FILTERING FALSE SIGNALS:
- Avoid trading during low volatility periods (ATR < recent average)
- Confirm with higher timeframe alignment
- Wait for price confirmation beyond divergence swing points
- Avoid trading during major economic news events

This strategy excels in ranging or slowing trending markets where momentum shifts provide reliable reversal opportunities with clear risk parameters.
