STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines moving average crossover signals with breakout confirmation on the QQQ ETF using 4-hour timeframes. The core approach adapts to market conditions by requiring price confirmation beyond the moving average crossover signals.

KEY COMPONENTS:
- Primary Instruments: QQQ ETF
- Timeframe: 4-hour charts exclusively
- Moving Averages: 20-period SMA (fast) and 200-period SMA (slow)
- Confirmation: Price breakout above/below recent swing highs/lows

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Simple Moving Average (20-period)
2. Simple Moving Average (200-period)
3. Price action analysis for swing high/low identification

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY (All conditions must be met):
1. 20 SMA crosses above 200 SMA (bullish crossover)
2. Price breaks above the most recent swing high
3. Enter on the first 4-hour candle that closes above the swing high level

SHORT ENTRY (All conditions must be met):
1. 20 SMA crosses below 200 SMA (bearish crossover)
2. Price breaks below the most recent swing low
3. Enter on the first 4-hour candle that closes below the swing low level

EXIT RULES:
LONG POSITION EXIT:
- When 20 SMA crosses below 200 SMA (crossover exit)
- OR price closes below the 200 SMA (trend failure exit)

SHORT POSITION EXIT:
- When 20 SMA crosses above 200 SMA (crossover exit)
- OR price closes above the 200 SMA (trend failure exit)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Maximum 2% of account capital per trade
- Stop loss: Place 2% below entry price for long positions, 2% above for short positions
- Trailing stops: Consider moving stop to breakeven when trade reaches 1:1 risk-reward ratio
- Maximum concurrent positions: 3 trades maximum to avoid overexposure

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Wait for candle close confirmation on all signals
- Avoid trading during major economic announcements
- Monitor overall market conditions (SPY correlation)
- The 200 SMA serves as primary trend filter
- Strategy works best in trending market conditions, may underperform in range-bound markets

This adaptive approach ensures entries only occur when both the moving average alignment and price momentum confirm the directional bias, reducing false signals common with basic crossover strategies.
