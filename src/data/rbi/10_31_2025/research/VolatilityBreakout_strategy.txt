STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityBreakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy capitalizes on periods of low volatility followed by high-probability breakout moves using Bollinger Bands as the primary volatility and momentum indicator.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Volatility Squeeze Detection: Identifies periods of compressed volatility when Bollinger Bands contract significantly
2. Breakout Confirmation: Waits for price to break outside the Bollinger Band boundaries with volume confirmation
3. Momentum Validation: Uses additional indicators to confirm the strength and direction of the breakout move

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
- Volume indicator (Volume SMA or OBV)
- Optional: RSI (14-period) for momentum confirmation
- Optional: MACD for trend direction confirmation

ENTRY RULES:
1. SQUEEZE CONDITION: Bollinger Band width must be at its lowest levels in recent periods (typically bottom 20% of recent width readings)
2. BREAKOUT DIRECTION: Enter long when price closes ABOVE the upper Bollinger Band, or enter short when price closes BELOW the lower Bollinger Band
3. VOLUME CONFIRMATION: Breakout must occur on above-average volume (volume > 20-period volume SMA)
4. TIMING: Enter on the next candle's open after the breakout confirmation

EXIT RULES:
1. PROFIT TARGET: Take profit when price reaches the opposite Bollinger Band (for long: lower band, for short: upper band)
2. TRAILING STOP: Use the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA) as a trailing stop - exit when price closes back inside the bands
3. TIME-BASED EXIT: If no significant move occurs within 5-10 periods after entry, consider exiting to preserve capital
4. REVERSAL SIGNAL: Exit if the opposite breakout signal occurs (long position gets short signal)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. POSITION SIZING: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. STOP LOSS: Place initial stop loss at the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
3. VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENT: Adjust position size based on current Bollinger Band width - smaller positions during high volatility periods
4. MULTIPLE TIME FRAME: Confirm squeeze conditions on higher timeframes before trading on lower timeframes

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Avoid trading during major economic news events when false breakouts are common
- Look for consecutive squeeze patterns for higher probability setups
- Combine with market structure analysis (support/resistance levels) for better entry timing
- The strategy works best in ranging markets transitioning to trending conditions
