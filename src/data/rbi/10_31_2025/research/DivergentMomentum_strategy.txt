STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines RSI divergence patterns with MACD confirmation signals on QQQ daily charts to identify high-probability momentum reversal opportunities.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - 14-period standard setting
2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - 12,26,9 standard settings
3. QQQ daily timeframe analysis
4. Divergence detection between price action and RSI
5. MACD crossover confirmation

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
- Bullish RSI divergence detected (price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low)
- MACD histogram shows positive momentum (rising above zero line or showing upward slope)
- MACD line crosses above signal line
- Enter on next candle open after all conditions are met

SHORT ENTRY:
- Bearish RSI divergence detected (price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high)
- MACD histogram shows negative momentum (falling below zero line or showing downward slope)
- MACD line crosses below signal line
- Enter on next candle open after all conditions are met

EXIT RULES:
LONG EXIT:
- MACD line crosses below signal line
- OR RSI reaches overbought territory (above 70)
- OR trailing stop loss triggered

SHORT EXIT:
- MACD line crosses above signal line
- OR RSI reaches oversold territory (below 30)
- OR trailing stop loss triggered

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size: Maximum 2% of capital per trade
- Stop loss: Place below recent swing low (long) or above recent swing high (short)
- Risk-reward ratio: Minimum 1:2
- Maximum drawdown per trade: 1% of total capital

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. RSI (14) - for divergence detection and overbought/oversold levels
2. MACD (12,26,9) - for momentum confirmation and trend direction
3. Price action analysis for swing highs/lows identification

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Focus on clear, well-defined divergence patterns
- Avoid trading during major economic events or earnings periods
- Confirm divergence across multiple swing points for higher reliability
- Use volume confirmation for added conviction in divergence signals
- Monitor overall market conditions and sector rotation for QQQ context
