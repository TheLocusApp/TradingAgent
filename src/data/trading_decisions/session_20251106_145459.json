However, RSI at 31.56 suggests oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce. The MACD remains negative at -2.402 but appears to be stabilizing.

The price at $611.89 is slightly below EMA20 ($612.43) but above EMA50, indicating neutral positioning. RSI at 32.39 suggests oversold conditions on the 7-period timeframe, which could support a bounce, but the MACD remains negative at -0.688. The intraday price series shows recent weakness from $613.93 down to $611.89, but we're seeing potential stabilization around current levels. With 0DTE options, theta decay is accelerating, and without clear directional momentum or a strong catalyst, the risk of entering a new position outweighs potential reward.
