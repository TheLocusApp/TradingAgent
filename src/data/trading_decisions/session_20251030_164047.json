The 4h timeframe shows bearish structure with price below both 20 and 50-period EMAs, and declining MACD values. Volume is below average, indicating lack of strong conviction. Given the mixed signals between short-term neutral/bullish and longer-term bearish context, and the declining momentum on MACD, a hold position is prudent to await clearer directional confirmation.",
