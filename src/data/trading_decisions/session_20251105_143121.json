          "confidence": 65,
          "reasoning": "The underlying is trading at $619.02, slightly below the EMA20 of $619.52, indicating weak momentum. MACD is negative at -0.643 and RSI at 38.75 shows oversold conditions but no clear reversal signal yet. The price has been choppy in a tight range around $619 with no strong directional bias. For 0DTE options, theta decay is accelerating and current volatility doesn't justify taking a directional position. Both CALL and PUT premiums are relatively expensive given the lack of clear trend. Better to wait for a clearer breakout or stronger momentum signal before entering a position.",
