The 7-period RSI at 26.31 suggests oversold conditions, but the 14-period RSI at 31.875 isn't yet at extreme oversold levels. The 4-hour timeframe confirms the bearish trend with price well below both 20 and 50-period EMAs. Volume is significantly elevated (223B vs 3.8B average), suggesting capitulation selling. While oversold conditions may present a potential bounce opportunity, the strong bearish momentum and deteriorating longer-term indicators suggest waiting for stabilization. Current small positions in BTC and ETH are essentially flat, so no urgent action needed. Better to wait for either a clear reversal signal or further oversold conditions before adding to positions.",
