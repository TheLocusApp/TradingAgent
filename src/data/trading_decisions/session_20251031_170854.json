While the RSI(7) at 71.785 shows overbought conditions, the MACD is improving from deeply negative levels (-289.118 vs previous -315.997), suggesting potential momentum shift. However, the longer-term 4h timeframe shows price below both 20 and 50 EMAs with negative MACD, indicating broader bearish pressure. The high current volume (12.38B vs 3.18B average) suggests significant activity but direction is unclear. Given the mixed signals between short-term momentum improvement and longer-term bearish structure, and with RSI(7) in overbought territory, waiting for clearer confirmation is prudent.
