          "reasoning": "The underlying is trading at $620.11, slightly below the EMA20 of $620.56, indicating weak momentum. MACD remains negative at -0.620 and RSI at 34.18 shows oversold conditions but no clear reversal signal yet. The price has been consolidating between $619.40-$620.11 over recent periods with no strong directional move. For 0DTE options, theta decay is accelerating rapidly - the CALL premium of $4.23 and PUT premium of $0.09 reflect this time pressure. Without clear directional momentum or catalyst, entering a position carries high risk of theta decay eating into any potential gains. Better to wait for a clearer breakout signal before committing capital.",
