The 4-hour timeframe shows bearish momentum with MACD deeply negative and declining (-1033.275), RSI extremely oversold at 21.653, and price below both 20 and 50-period EMAs. However, the extreme oversold conditions on the 4-hour chart combined with massive volume spike (9959M vs 3218M average) suggests potential capitulation, but without any recent 3-minute data to confirm short-term direction, entering a position would be speculative. The high volume spike in oversold territory could indicate either panic selling or accumulation, but I need actual price action on the 3-minute timeframe to make an informed trading decision.
