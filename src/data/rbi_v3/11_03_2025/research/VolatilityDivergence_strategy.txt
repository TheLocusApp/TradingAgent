STRATEGY_NAME: VolatilityDivergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility analysis with divergence detection specifically designed for BTC on 4-hour timeframes. The approach focuses on identifying momentum shifts during periods of high volatility through multiple divergence confirmations.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Primary Indicators:
   - RSI (14-period) for momentum divergence detection
   - Bollinger Bands (20,2) for volatility assessment
   - Volume profile for confirmation
   - MACD (12,26,9) for trend direction

2. Volatility Framework:
   - Monitor Bollinger Band width expansion/contraction
   - Track price position relative to bands (upper/middle/lower)
   - Identify volatility breakouts when price moves outside bands

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY (Bullish Divergence):
1. RSI forms higher low while price forms lower low
2. Price touches or crosses below lower Bollinger Band
3. MACD histogram shows bullish divergence
4. Volume increases on the divergence bar
5. Wait for price to close back inside Bollinger Bands

SHORT ENTRY (Bearish Divergence):
1. RSI forms lower high while price forms higher high
2. Price touches or crosses above upper Bollinger Band
3. MACD histogram shows bearish divergence
4. Volume increases on the divergence bar
5. Wait for price to close back inside Bollinger Bands

EXIT RULES:
LONG EXIT:
- Price reaches middle Bollinger Band (take partial profits)
- RSI crosses above 70 (overbought)
- MACD shows bearish crossover
- Price closes below recent swing low

SHORT EXIT:
- Price reaches middle Bollinger Band (take partial profits)
- RSI crosses below 30 (oversold)
- MACD shows bullish crossover
- Price closes above recent swing high

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size: 2-3% of capital per trade
- Stop loss: 2% below/above entry price or recent swing low/high
- Maximum drawdown: 8% per week
- Risk-reward ratio: Minimum 1:2
- Only trade during high volatility periods (Bollinger Band width expanding)

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. RSI (14) - for divergence detection
2. Bollinger Bands (20,2) - for volatility and support/resistance
3. MACD (12,26,9) - for trend confirmation
4. Volume - for momentum validation
5. Price action - for swing high/low identification

FILTERING CONDITIONS:
- Only trade when Bollinger Band width is above its 20-period average (high volatility)
- Avoid trading during consolidation (narrow bands)
- Confirm divergence across at least 2 timeframes (4h + 1h)
- Wait for volume confirmation on divergence bars

This strategy excels in capturing reversal opportunities during volatile market conditions while using multiple confirmations to filter false signals.
