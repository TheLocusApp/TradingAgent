STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated mean reversion strategy designed specifically for SPY on the 1-hour timeframe, combining multiple technical indicators to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversal points.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
- Primary mean reversion using Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- Momentum confirmation with RSI (14)
- Volume validation for entry signals
- Dynamic stop-loss and profit-taking based on volatility

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Bollinger Bands (20 periods, 2 standard deviations)
2. RSI (14 periods)
3. Volume (standard)
4. ATR (14 periods) for risk management

ENTRY RULES (LONG):
1. Price touches or crosses below the lower Bollinger Band
2. RSI reading below 30 (oversold condition)
3. Volume must be above 20-period average (confirms selling pressure)
4. Wait for price to close back inside the Bollinger Band
5. Enter long on the next candle's open

ENTRY RULES (SHORT):
1. Price touches or crosses above the upper Bollinger Band
2. RSI reading above 70 (overbought condition)
3. Volume must be above 20-period average (confirms buying pressure)
4. Wait for price to close back inside the Bollinger Band
5. Enter short on the next candle's open

EXIT RULES:
- Take profit when price reaches the middle Bollinger Band (20-period SMA)
- Alternative profit target: 1.5x ATR from entry price
- Exit if RSI reaches opposite extreme (above 70 for long trades, below 30 for short trades)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Stop loss placed at 2x ATR below entry for long positions
- Stop loss placed at 2x ATR above entry for short positions
- Maximum risk per trade: 1% of account equity
- No new trades if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (wait for reset)

FILTERING CONDITIONS:
- Avoid trading during first/last hour of market session
- Higher probability during trending markets (confirmed by 50-period SMA slope)
- Reduce position size during low volatility periods (ATR below 20-period average)

This adaptive approach combines traditional mean reversion principles with dynamic risk management, making it particularly effective for SPY's characteristic mean-reverting behavior on hourly timeframes.
