STRATEGY_NAME: DivergentMomentum

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines RSI divergence patterns with MACD confirmation signals on Bitcoin's daily timeframe to identify high-probability trend reversal opportunities.

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Set to 14 periods
2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Standard settings (12,26,9)
3. Price action analysis for divergence identification
4. Daily timeframe for reliable signals

ENTRY RULES (Long Position):
1. BULLISH RSI DIVERGENCE: Price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows
2. MACD CONFIRMATION: MACD line crosses above signal line OR MACD histogram shows bullish momentum
3. ENTRY: Enter long when both conditions are met on the same daily candle close

ENTRY RULES (Short Position):
1. BEARISH RSI DIVERGENCE: Price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs
2. MACD CONFIRMATION: MACD line crosses below signal line OR MACD histogram shows bearish momentum
3. ENTRY: Enter short when both conditions are met on the same daily candle close

EXIT RULES:
1. Take Profit: When RSI reaches overbought (70+) for long positions or oversold (30-) for short positions
2. Stop Loss: Place below recent swing low for long positions, above recent swing high for short positions
3. Alternative Exit: MACD reversal signal (opposite crossover)

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position Size: Maximum 2% of capital per trade
2. Stop Loss: 2-3% below/above entry price depending on volatility
3. Risk-Reward Ratio: Minimum 1:2
4. Avoid trading during major news events or extreme volatility periods

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- RSI (14 periods)
- MACD (12,26,9)
- Price chart with visible swing highs/lows

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Multiple divergence patterns (double/triple) provide stronger signals
- Consider market structure and key support/resistance levels for additional confirmation
