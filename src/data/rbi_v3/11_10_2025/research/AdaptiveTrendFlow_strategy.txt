STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveTrendFlow

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated trend-following strategy specifically designed for SPY daily charts that combines multiple timeframe analysis with adaptive entry/exit mechanisms.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Multi-timeframe trend confirmation using 20-day and 50-day EMAs
2. Volume-weighted momentum confirmation
3. Adaptive stop-loss and take-profit levels based on ATR
4. Trend strength assessment using ADX

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- EMA 20 (Exponential Moving Average)
- EMA 50 (Exponential Moving Average)
- ATR 14 (Average True Range)
- ADX 14 (Average Directional Index)
- Volume (standard volume indicator)

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
1. Price must be above both EMA 20 and EMA 50
2. EMA 20 must be above EMA 50 (confirmed uptrend)
3. ADX must be above 25 (strong trend confirmation)
4. Current day's close must be higher than previous day's close
5. Volume should be above 20-day average volume

SHORT ENTRY:
1. Price must be below both EMA 20 and EMA 50
2. EMA 20 must be below EMA 50 (confirmed downtrend)
3. ADX must be above 25 (strong trend confirmation)
4. Current day's close must be lower than previous day's close
5. Volume should be above 20-day average volume

EXIT RULES:
LONG EXIT:
1. Price closes below EMA 20
2. EMA 20 crosses below EMA 50
3. ADX drops below 20 (trend weakening)
4. Trailing stop: 2x ATR below the highest high since entry

SHORT EXIT:
1. Price closes above EMA 20
2. EMA 20 crosses above EMA 50
3. ADX drops below 20 (trend weakening)
4. Trailing stop: 2x ATR above the lowest low since entry

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position size: Maximum 2% of portfolio per trade
- Initial stop-loss: 2.5x ATR from entry price
- Maximum drawdown per trade: 5% of position value
- No new entries if portfolio drawdown exceeds 10%
- Only one position active at a time (long or short)

ADDITIONAL FILTERS:
- Avoid entering during first/last 30 minutes of trading day
- Skip trading on major economic announcement days (FOMC, CPI releases)
- Monitor for excessive gap openings (>1.5x ATR) which may invalidate setup

This adaptive approach ensures you're only trading strong, confirmed trends while dynamically adjusting risk parameters based on market volatility through ATR-based stops.
