STRATEGY_NAME: AdaptiveReversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a sophisticated mean reversion strategy specifically designed for SPY 1-hour timeframe that dynamically adapts to changing market volatility conditions.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Dynamic Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) - Primary mean reversion indicator
2. RSI (14-period) - Momentum confirmation filter
3. ATR (14-period) - Volatility-based position sizing and stop loss calculation
4. Volume confirmation - Ensures valid signals with above-average volume

ENTRY RULES (LONG):
- Price touches or crosses below lower Bollinger Band
- RSI below 30 (oversold condition)
- Volume above 20-period moving average
- No additional bearish momentum divergence present

ENTRY RULES (SHORT):
- Price touches or crosses above upper Bollinger Band
- RSI above 70 (overbought condition)
- Volume above 20-period moving average
- No additional bullish momentum divergence present

EXIT RULES:
- Primary: Price returns to 20-period SMA (middle Bollinger Band)
- Secondary: RSI crosses back above 45 (for longs) or below 55 (for shorts)
- Time-based: Close position after 5 bars if target not reached
- Emergency: 2x ATR stop loss from entry price

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Maximum position size: 2% of account equity per trade
- Stop loss: 2x ATR from entry price
- Maximum daily drawdown: 5% of account equity
- No new entries if 3 consecutive losing trades occur (wait for reset)
- Reduce position size by 50% during high VIX periods (>25)

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- RSI (14)
- ATR (14)
- Volume + 20-period volume MA
- 20-period Simple Moving Average

OPTIMIZATION NOTES:
- Backtest during different market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)
- Adjust ATR multiplier based on personal risk tolerance
- Consider adding VIX filter for enhanced risk management
- Monitor performance during Fed announcement days and adjust accordingly

This adaptive approach ensures the strategy remains effective across varying market conditions while maintaining strict risk controls appropriate for SPY's characteristics.
