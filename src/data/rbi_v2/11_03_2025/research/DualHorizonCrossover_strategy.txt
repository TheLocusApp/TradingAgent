STRATEGY_NAME: DualHorizonCrossover

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy utilizes a dual timeframe approach combining the 20-period and 200-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) on SPY hourly charts to capture both short-term momentum shifts and long-term trend direction.

KEY COMPONENTS:
- Primary Trend Filter: 200-period EMA (long-term trend direction)
- Signal Generator: 20-period EMA (short-term momentum)
- Instrument: SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)
- Timeframe: Hourly charts

INDICATORS REQUIRED:
- 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

ENTRY RULES:
LONG ENTRY:
1. Wait for 20 EMA to cross ABOVE 200 EMA (golden cross)
2. Enter on the next candle after crossover confirmation
3. Ensure price is trading above both EMAs at entry

SHORT ENTRY:
1. Wait for 20 EMA to cross BELOW 200 EMA (death cross)
2. Enter on the next candle after crossover confirmation
3. Ensure price is trading below both EMAs at entry

EXIT RULES:
LONG POSITIONS:
- Exit when 20 EMA crosses below 200 EMA
- Or use trailing stop of 2-3% below recent swing low

SHORT POSITIONS:
- Exit when 20 EMA crosses above 200 EMA
- Or use trailing stop of 2-3% above recent swing high

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Stop loss: Place 2-3% below entry for longs, 2-3% above entry for shorts
- Maximum drawdown: Limit to 5-8% of total capital
- Avoid trading during major economic announcements or extreme volatility

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- This strategy works best in trending markets, may generate false signals in ranging conditions
- Consider using volume confirmation to validate crossover signals
- Monitor for EMA convergence/divergence as potential early warning signs
- Backtest thoroughly on SPY historical hourly data before live implementation
- Consider combining with RSI or MACD for additional confirmation in choppy markets
