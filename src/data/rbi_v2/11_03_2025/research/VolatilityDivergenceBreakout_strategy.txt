STRATEGY_NAME: Volatility Divergence Breakout

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
This strategy combines multiple technical analysis concepts to identify high-probability trend entries during volatility expansion periods. The core approach detects bullish divergence when price makes lower lows while momentum indicators make higher lows, then confirms with volatility-based breakout signals. The strategy specifically requires simultaneous expansion in both Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel volatility measurements, creating a powerful convergence of momentum and volatility signals.

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Keltner Channel (20-period EMA with 2.0 ATR bands)
2. Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
3. RSI or MACD for divergence detection (14-period RSI recommended)
4. Price action for swing high/low identification

ENTRY RULES:
1. Identify BULLISH DIVERGENCE: Price forms a lower low while momentum indicator (RSI/MACD) forms a higher low
2. Confirm VOLATILITY EXPANSION: Bollinger Bands must be visibly wider than recent periods, indicating increased market volatility
3. Wait for BREAKOUT CONFIRMATION: Price must close above the upper Keltner Channel line
4. All three conditions must occur within 1-3 candles of each other for valid entry

EXIT RULES:
1. Primary exit: Close long position when price closes below the Keltner Channel midline (20-period EMA)
2. Alternative exit: If significant profit has been captured, consider exiting when price touches or exceeds the upper Bollinger Band
3. Emergency exit: Immediate exit if price closes below the lower Keltner Channel line

RISK MANAGEMENT:
1. Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
2. Stop loss: Place initial stop loss below the most recent swing low that formed the divergence pattern
3. Trailing stop: Consider moving stop to breakeven once price moves 1.5x ATR in your favor
4. Volatility filter: Avoid entries when Bollinger Band width is below its 20-period average (low volatility environment)
5. Timeframe consideration: This strategy works best on 1-hour to daily timeframes for reliable divergence patterns

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- The combination of expanded Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel breakout creates a high-confidence signal as both volatility indicators confirm the move
- Bullish divergence provides early warning of potential trend reversal, while the channel breakout confirms momentum shift
- This strategy performs best in transitioning markets where volatility is increasing and trends are beginning to form
- Always verify divergence quality - the stronger and clearer the divergence pattern, the higher the probability of success
