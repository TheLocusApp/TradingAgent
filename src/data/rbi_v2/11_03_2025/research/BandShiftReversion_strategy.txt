STRATEGY_NAME: BandShift Reversion

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This mean-reversion strategy capitalizes on temporary price dislocations by identifying when Bollinger Bands signal oversold conditions while maintaining underlying trend strength, using ATR-based stops to capture multiple re-test opportunities.

KEY COMPONENTS:
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations)
- 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Average True Range (ATR, 14-period)
- Price action analysis for re-test confirmation

ENTRY RULES:
1. Primary Condition: Bollinger Band lower band must be trading ABOVE the 20-period SMA
2. Confirmation: Price must touch or cross below the Bollinger Band lower band
3. Entry Trigger: Enter long position on the first bullish candle following the touch/cross
4. Timeframe: Best suited for 1-hour to 4-hour charts for optimal signal frequency

EXIT RULES:
1. Initial Stop Loss: Place stop loss at 2x ATR below entry price
2. Re-test Management: If stopped out, re-enter on next bullish candle following another touch of the lower band
3. Profit Taking: Take partial profits at 1x ATR above entry, move stop to breakeven
4. Final Exit: Close remaining position when price touches Bollinger Band middle line (20 SMA) or after capturing 2x ATR profit

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Position sizing: Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Maximum 2 re-entries allowed per setup to avoid over-trading
- Daily loss limit: 5% of account equity
- Avoid trading during major economic news events
- Monitor for changing volatility conditions that may invalidate the strategy

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
1. Bollinger Bands (20,2)
2. Simple Moving Average (20-period)
3. Average True Range (14-period)
4. Optional: Volume confirmation for entry validation

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
This strategy works best in ranging or mildly trending markets. Avoid using during strong trending conditions where mean-reversion setups have lower success rates. The unique "BandShift" condition (lower band above SMA) helps filter false signals by ensuring the underlying trend remains intact while capturing oversold bounces.
