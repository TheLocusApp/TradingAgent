STRATEGY_NAME: Volatility Divergence

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy combines volatility analysis with divergence detection to identify potential trend reversals during periods of high market volatility.

KEY STRATEGY COMPONENTS:
1. Volatility Measurement: Uses Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) to gauge market volatility
2. Divergence Detection: Compares price action with momentum oscillator (RSI 14-period)
3. Volatility Threshold: Requires Bollinger Band width expansion above historical average
4. Multi-timeframe Confirmation: Analyzes both primary and higher timeframe for alignment

REQUIRED INDICATORS:
- Bollinger Bands (20,2)
- RSI (14-period)
- Volume indicator
- ATR (14-period) for volatility confirmation

ENTRY RULES (Long Position):
1. Bollinger Band width must be 20% above 50-period average (high volatility condition)
2. Price makes lower low while RSI makes higher low (bullish divergence)
3. Divergence occurs near lower Bollinger Band
4. Volume increases during divergence formation
5. Price closes above the 20-period SMA for confirmation
6. Higher timeframe shows similar bullish structure

ENTRY RULES (Short Position):
1. Bollinger Band width must be 20% above 50-period average (high volatility condition)
2. Price makes higher high while RSI makes lower high (bearish divergence)
3. Divergence occurs near upper Bollinger Band
4. Volume increases during divergence formation
5. Price closes below the 20-period SMA for confirmation
6. Higher timeframe shows similar bearish structure

EXIT RULES:
- Take Profit: Previous swing high/low or opposite Bollinger Band
- Stop Loss: 1.5x ATR beyond entry candle extreme
- Time-based exit if target not reached within 5 periods

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Maximum 2% risk per trade
- Position size based on ATR stop distance
- No new entries during low volatility periods (Bollinger Band width below average)
- Daily loss limit of 5% total account
- Correlation check with major indices before entry

SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
- Strategy works best during earnings seasons, economic announcements, or market uncertainty
- Avoid trading during overnight gaps or illiquid periods
- Requires minimum 1:2 risk-reward ratio
- Divergence must be clear and not minor fluctuations
