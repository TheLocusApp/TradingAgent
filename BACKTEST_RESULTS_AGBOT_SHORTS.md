## 💡 Recommendations

### For Improvement
1. **Increase Position Size**
   - Current sizing too conservative
   - Adjust risk-per-trade from 2.5% to 5-10%
   - Ensure margin is sufficient for entries

2. **Optimize Entry Signals**
   - Current crossover/crossunder too simplistic
   - Add confirmation filters (volume, momentum)
   - Consider trend strength indicators

3. **Reduce Timeframe**
   - Test on 5m or 15m for more trades
   - More opportunities = higher returns
   - Maintain same risk management

4. **Add Filters**
   - EMA filter working (from previous memory)
   - Regime detection reduces bad trades
   - Combine with volatility filters

### For Options Trading
✅ **This strategy is suitable for options:**
- Tight stops = defined risk (perfect for options)
- 52% win rate = good probability
- 0.20% per trade = can leverage with options
- Example: 5% risk per trade on QQQ puts/calls = 25% annual return
